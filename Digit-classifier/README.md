# Digit-classifier

Implementation of an algorithm for classifying handwritten numbers based on the MNIST dataset.
The model consists of two fully connected nonlinear layers. The activation function after the first layer is the ReLU function, and after the second softmax.
Parameter optimization is performed using classical gradient boosting.

The model is described in the *model.py* file.
