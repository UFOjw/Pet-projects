# Digit-classifier

Implementation of an algorithm for classifying handwritten numbers based on the **MNIST** dataset.
The model consists of two **fully connected** nonlinear layers. The activation function after the first layer is the **ReLU** function, and after the second softmax.
Parameter optimization is performed using classical gradient descent.

The model is described in the `model.py` file.

The `prediction.py` file describes methods for inference with visualization.
