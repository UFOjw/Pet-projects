# Naive-Bayes

A Bayesian classifier is a probabilistic algorithm used in machine learning and statistics for categorization and prediction tasks. It is based on Bayes' theorem, which calculates the probability of a hypothesis given prior knowledge and evidence. The classifier uses these probabilities to assign a class label to new instances based on their feature values.

This classifier uses an iris dataset to train and prediction.
